            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Each image can be clicked only once, and they must be clicked in sequential order (i.e.1st, 2nd,
                    3rd, and then 4th).</li>
                <li>When you click on the 1st image, a registration form will appear, prompting you to enter your name,
                    email, and username.</li>
                <li>After successfully registering then click on the 2nd image will show the names and usernames of all
                    registered players.</li>
                <li>Now, click on the 3rd image (which shows a dice). Click it a maximum of three times. After three
                    clicks, the game will check if the sum of all three randomly generated values is greater than 10.
                </li>
                <li>If the sum is greater than 10, you'll be allowed to click on the 4th image. If not, you will receive
                    a message: "Try again after scoring more than 10."</li>
                <li>When the 4th image is clicked, it will generate a random 12-digit coupon code. The coupon code
                    should be styled accordingly.</li>
                <li>If you successfully generate a 12-digit coupon code, you'll be congratulated with a special message
                    or image.</li>
                <li>If, on the 3rd image, you fail to achieve a total sum greater than 10 even after three clicks,
                    you'll receive a message: "Bad luck" and won't be given another chance.</li>
                <li>Enjoy the game and good luck in your quest to unlock the 12-digit coupon code!</li>
            </ul>
