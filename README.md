# Gallary Game

1. Each image can be clicked only once, and they must be clicked in sequential order (i.e.1st, 2nd,3rd, and then 4th).
2. When you click on the 1st image, a registration form will appear, prompting you to enter your name,email, and username.
3. After successfully registering then click on the 2nd image will show the names and usernames of all registered players.
4. Now, click on the 3rd image (which shows a dice). Click it a maximum of three times. After three clicks, the game will check if the sum of all three randomly generated values is greater than 10.
5. If the sum is greater than 10, you'll be allowed to click on the 4th image. If not, you will receive a message: "Try again after scoring more than 10."
6. When the 4th image is clicked, it will generate a random 12-digit coupon code. The coupon code should be styled accordingly.
7. If you successfully generate a 12-digit coupon code, you'll be congratulated with a special message or image.
8. If, on the 3rd image, you fail to achieve a total sum greater than 10 even after three clicks,you'll receive a message: "Bad luck" and won't be given another chance.
9. Enjoy the game and good luck in your quest to unlock the 12-digit coupon code!
